# C++sample
This is a file system written in C++. This was a final project for a class in entirely c++. I worked with 2 other students to create a file system in C++ where files of multiple different types can be created, edited, copied, deleted, moved, renamed etc. I have only ran it using visual studio on windows but I imagine it would compile with something like GCC on other systems. Everything excluding the unit tests was written by us. Navigate to Lab5/Lab5 to see the testing done by my group to see some of the commands able to be used.
