# C-sample
This was a final project for a class in entirely c++. I worked with 2 other students to create a file system in C++ where files of multiple different types can be created, edited, copied, deleted, moved, renamed etc. I have only ran it using visual studio on windows but it could probably compile in other ways. Everything excluding the unit tests was written by us.
