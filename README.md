# C++sample
This was a final project for a class in entirely c++. I worked with 2 other students to create a file system in C++ where files of multiple different types can be created, edited, copied, deleted, moved, renamed etc. I have only ran it using visual studio on windows but I imagine it would compile with something like GCC on other systems. Everything excluding the unit tests was written by us.
